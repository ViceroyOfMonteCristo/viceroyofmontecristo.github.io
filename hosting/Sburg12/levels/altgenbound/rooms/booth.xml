								@dickle_explaining Dickle: hey vrachne is it alright if i ask you some more questions?
@vrachne_peevedcross Vrachne: more questions?! jeez dickle i thought you’d be all questioned out by now
@dickle_talk Dickle: well since we’re here we aren’t really on the clock anymore right? that was mostly the reason i stopped asking about stuff earlier
@vrachne_peeved Vrachne: fine, just go ahead and ask dickle
@dickle_explaining Dickle: alright! I’m sorry if this comes off as like rude but uh do you have more than two eyes?
@dickle_explaining Dickle: like i’ve noticed you cover one side of your face with your hair and it looks really nice but i’m interested to know, ya know?
@vrachne_smug Vrachne: well i could show you. 
@vrachne_horror Vrachne: But then i’d have to #ff0000 KILL YOU.
@dickle_scared Dickle: oh okay thats okay i dont need to know okay okay okay
@vrachne_laugh Vrachne: ahue ahue ahue relaxxxxxx i’m just joking around
@vrachne_smug Vrachne: if you’re really that curious then here. 
@vrachne_eye Vrachne: it’s nothing that special see?
@dickle_excited Dickle: whoaaa! Those are pretty cool!
@dickle_excited Dickle: can you uh see out of those?
@vrachne_eye Vrachne: i’ll answer your question with another question dickle.
@vrachne_eye Vrachne: if i could see out of these why would i cover them with my hair.
@dickle_shrug Dickle: because it’d look cool?
@dickle_talk Dickle: i’m kidding, sorry for the stupid question!
@vrachne_eye Vrachne: i’m used to it by now dickle its fine.
@dickle_think Dickle: but wait why do you have them if you can’t see out of them?
@vrachne_shrug Vrachne: beats me. I’m pretty sure these eyes are supposed to actually work
@vrachne_talk Vrachne: but i guess i didn’t come out “right” when i was made
@dickle_talk Dickle: Is that my fault?
@vrachne_smugshrug Vrachne: who knows it could be, though it’s much more likely that this version of the game was just coded by an idiot
@dickle_smug Dickle: yeah i’ve got an itching feeling that might be it
@dickle_happy Dickle: thanks for answering my question though
@vrachne_talk Vrachne: you dont have to thank me for that dickle, as long as it isn’t about “your” quest i’ll probably answer
@dickle_talk Dickle: i’ll keep that in mind

								@dickle_talk Dickle: that’s some statue eh?
@vrachne_talk Vrachne: its pretty alright i suppose 
@vrachne_talk Vrachne: kinda tacky with the fist in the air thing though
@dickle_explaining Dickle: do you think its like their god or something?
@vrachne_peeved Vrachne: how should i know? It’s not like i live here, i don’t know the culture.
@dickle_explaining Dickle: well i just thought since you’re supposed to be like my guide and stuff you’d know about it or something
@vrachne_peeved Vrachne: my knowledge begins and ends with YOUR quest dickle thats it.
@vrachne_peevedcross Vrachne: i really don’t have any interest in these “things” stupid hookey pokey religion.
@dickle_talk Dickle: that’s pretty harsh.
@vrachne_smugshrug Vrachne: hey i’m just being honest.
@dickle_smug Dickle: well do you believe in any gods or stuff like that? 
@vrachne_smug Vrachne: do you?
@dickle_shrug Dickle: ehhhh probably not, i’m pretty agnostic i guess? aside from praying as a joke sometimes
@vrachne_talk Vrachne: i like to look at it this way dickle.
@vrachne_explaining Vrachne: if there was anything better than us we’d absolutely know for sure right?
@dickle_thinking Dickle: would we?
@vrachne_smug Vrachne: well i would know, but you get my point i’m sure
@vrachne_smugcross Vrachne: anything with a brain is naturally curious, and if an entire species is curious about something, it’ll be figured out eventually, right?
@dickle_shrug Dickle: yeah that makes sense to me
@vrachne_smugshrug Vrachne: all i’m saying is, if there was one plenty of people would know about it by now!
@vrachne_smugcross Vrachne: so as it is now, no. i don’t believe in any  “higher power”.
@vrachne_smugcross Vrachne: was that a good enough answer dickle?
@dickle_explaining Dickle: yeah sure, honestly thats probably the best way you can answer that question, in my opinion at least

@vrachne_shrug Vrachne: not here at least.
@dickle_smug Dickle: you’re saying the games messed up something again right?

@dickle_smug Dickle: honestly i’ve run out of things to talk about when it comes to game things heh.
@dickle_shrug Dickle: so let talk about normal stuff!
@dickle_explaining Dickle: i’ll start ahem. some weather we’re havin today huh?
@vrachne_peevedcross Vrachne: oh yeah i love perpetual overcast, really interesting to talk about.
@dickle_shrug Dickle: okay maybe thats a bad one to start with uhhhh
@dickle_think Dickle: hmmm, what else….
@dickle_excited Dickle: I’VE GOT IT!
@dickle_excited Dickle: POLITICS!!!!!!!!!
@vrachne_confused Vrachne: what.
@dickle_explaining Dickle: i’m sure you know what politics are vrachne!
@dickle_explaining Dickle: seedy guys and gals, corruption, dirty money all that good stuff!
@vrachne_peeved Vrachne: what do politics have to do with anything?
@dickle_talk Dickle: eh nothing probably but i have a funny story about it all if you’re interested
@vrachne_peevedcross Vrachne: just spit it out so we can stop talking about it dickle.
@dickle_explaining Dickle: alright so you know elections and stuff right? You know voting and all that silly jazz like that
@vrachne_talkcrossed Vrachne: a bit. I’ve never voted though.
@dickle_talk Dickle: don’t worry about it i haven’t either!
@dickle_smug Dickle: mostly because i’m too young to vote heh
@dickle_explaining Dickle: anyway so there’s this election right it’s like 2015 or whatever and there’s these 2 candidates some girl and some dude both of em are pretty unlikeable but for different reasons, so unlikeable that people genuinely elect im not joking you here, a VERY dead gorilla
@vrachne_veryconfused Vrachne: how. how does that happen.
@dickle_explaining Dickle: like everybody wrote in those votes i think? it might’ve started as a joke but it was a pretty damn universal joke!
@dickle_talk Dickle: so anyway the dead gorilla wins the election right and i’m just sitting there and wondering "how is a dead gorilla gonna be president" and i swear, on any god that might or might not exist, that a man in a monkey suit just waddles out to the presidential
podium and starts making monkey sounds and they got this dude to the side translating
@dickle_talkcrossed Dickle: it was like watching an episode of some kids cartoon, it was WILD the news reporters were just asking question after question and the man in the monkey suit just goes OOO O HA HA you know, monkey sounds
@dickle_talk Dickle: and the dude off to the side is just sweating bullets trying to answer the questions for him
@dickle_think Dickle: watching it all unfold was like watching a uhhhh
@dickle_talk Dickle: oh it was like watching a clown car crash!
@dickle_fingerguns Dickle: it’s tragic because you know it’s a car crash but at the same time it’s kinda funny because it’s a clown car! or something like that i don’t know
@vrachne_smugcross Vrachne: sounds like a lot of “monkey business”
@vrachne_smugcross Vrachne: what’d the guy actually do in office though?
@vrachne_talkcrossed Vrachne: i doubt he’d last long if all he did was make monkey noises
@dickle_talk Dickle: well this all happened like a month or so before i got into all this nonsense, so he had some time to do stuff, surprisingly most of it wasn’t really that out of line i think? but then again i know jack about politics so i could be completely wrong about that
@dickle_talk Dickle: notice how i said “most” of what he did wasn’t out of line. he did something absolutely wild like a week ago
@vrachne_smug Vrachne: what did he do? instate some kind of banana tax or something ahue ahue.
@dickle_talk Dickle: you’d think so right? but no he actually didn’t do that
@dickle_airquotes Dickle: he no joke announced on tv in the god-damn monkey suit that he was making a “satellite defense system to repel foregin extraterrestrial objects or invaders”
@dickle_talk Dickle: well actually he didn’t announce it he just made monkey noises and the dude on the side announced it but you get what i’m saying right?
@vrachne_laugh Vrachne: AHUEAHUEAHUEAHUEAHUE that’s some good comedy, sounds like my kind of broadcast
@dickle_happy Dickle: i know right?! i was losing my mind over it, though i didn’t actually watch the tv broadcast of it. 
@dickle_smug Dickle: because who actually wants to torture themselves caring about politics eh eehheheheheh
@dickle_talk Dickle: i mostly heard about it through discord and people having a laugh about it all
@dickle_smug Dickle: or you know being incredibly scared about the fact that we may have a mentally ill man in a monkey suit running the country.
@dickle_shrugsmug Dickle: i don’t have to worry about it now though considering im here! lucky me right? heh
@dickle_talk Dickle: anyway that was my wacky politics story i hope you liked it!
@vrachne_smug Vrachne: it was certainly something, that’s about the best way i can put it ahue
@vrachne_smugcross Vrachne: question though, did that satellite stuff get finished at all, it sounds very interesting, if it actually works that is.
@dickle_think Dickle: uhhhh i’m not sure actually, like i said this was like a week before all of this started so probably not? but you never know with government projects like those eh
@dickle_talk Dickle: in the announcement about it they said it would use like lasers or something like that!
@dickle_smug Dickle: it’s totally like something out of a bad shlocky early 90’s anime
@dickle_fingerguns Dickle: or a really bad 2000s action movie, take your pick!
@vrachne_talk Vrachne: i’ll take the bad action movie, who knows it could be a cult classic
@dickle_talk Dickle: hehe yeah
