		<args>@! #9900ff Did you ever end up reading ## #274e13 WORM ## #9900ff man?

@! #ebb719 I would’ve but it doesn’t have any pictures so i’m not really that interested in it, i prefer my reading with a bit of a visual kick ya know?

@! #9900ff I’m telling you man it’s really worth reading, you’ll get into it so hard you won’t need pictures!
There’s this lady who learns how to control bugs and stuff it’s wild, she even gets a cool super suit for it and everything

@! #ebb719 I don’t know i’m not really into super hero stuff…

@! #9900ff Whatever dude, sorry that it’s not that dead comic you love talking about so much.

@! #ebb719 It’s. Not. Dead.

@! #9900ff It hasn’t had a new issue in months dude.

@! #ebb719 Yeah so?! Good stuff takes time, i’m sure it’ll come back.

@! #9900ff Whatever you say man.

		<args>@! Hey uh, don't tell her i've been doing this but i've been looking through this ladies window for the past hour now and she's just been staring at her bed sheets.

I kinda wanna go in there and check on her but i don't know it just seems rude to barge into someone's house like that...

like what if she wasn't having any trouble at all and it's just something she does every day, i'd be so embarrassed…
