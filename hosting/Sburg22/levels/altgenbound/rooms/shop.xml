@vrachne_surprised Vrachne: god do these roads ever end?!
@vrachne_surprised Vrachne: i’m getting tired of floating around this place.
@dickle_happy Dickle: VRACHNE WAIT!!
@dickle_happy Dickle: there’s a crack!
@vrachne_confused Vrachne: what about it?
@dickle_excited Dickle: those things aren’t good to go over ya know!
@dickle_excited Dickle: there’s a saying about it and everything!
@vrachne_peevedcross Vrachne: mhm yeah. sure there is.
@dickle_talk Dickle: i’m not joking, i’m being completely serious, honest!
@vrachne_smug Vrachne: what’s the saying then huh?
@dickle_talk Dickle: alright it goes something like uh.
@dickle_talk Dickle: Wenn du auf einem Riss gehst, brichst du deiner Mutter den Rücken!
@dickle_talk Dickle: to put that into like english that’s uh “if you walk on a crack you break your mama’s back!” or something along those lines
@vrachne_peevedcross Vrachne: I FLOAT.
@dickle_talk Dickle: that’s even worse! Because there’s a totally different saying for that exact sorta thing!
@dickle_talk Dickle: Wenn Sie über einem Riss schweben, Sie brechen sich den Rücken!
@dickle_talk Dickle: “When you hover over a crack, you break your own back!”
@vrachne_peevedcross Vrachne: I DONT HAVE BONES.
@dickle_talk Dickle: still is that something you really wanna risk?!
@dickle_talk Dickle: those kinda haunted sayings have a way of catching up with you, trust me i’d know! And don’t ask me how i know because i really rather not go into it!
@dickle_talk Dickle: plus i’m sure we’ll get totally lost if we wander off too far so let’s just stay here okay?
@vrachne_talk Vrachne: you didn’t have to go into that entire spiel about cracks if that’s all you wanted to tell me.
@dickle_talk Dickle: yeah but that’s way less fun hehe
@dickle_talk Dickle: plus i bet you would get on my case too if i started wandering too far off, so it’s only fair!
@dickle_talk Vrachne: i woul-
@vrachne_peeved Vrachne: honestly you know what? forget it. I don’t care anymore, this place sucks anyway let’s just go back.
@dickle_excited Dickle: fine by me! there’s still plenty of stuff to explore in this part of town anyway!

			@! I wouldn't buy anything here, Mal's a total cheapskate, all she sells is literal trash.

She used to try and pawn the stuff she got on her deep dives to the rest of the people in town, thankfully nobody bought into her crap, least till the tourists came around.

If it wasn't for them she'd probably lose the building, I'd love to see the look on her face if that happened.

			@! I wanted ICE but all they have here is VP-

#4b516f ( blah blah ice drinks whatever, can you just stop talking, i don’t care and i don’t think i ever will.)

(if nobody was looking i could totally get away with stuffing this “thing” into the ice box, now that’d be fun.)
