@dickle_peeved Dickle: What? Why?!
@vrachne_peevedcross Vrachne: it’s degrading. the little thing thinks its so high and mighty because it sits in a booth all day, it makes me sick.
@dickle_angryflustered Dickle: are you serious?! We’ve been walking for hours and you’re pulling this now?!
@vrachne_peevedcross Vrachne: why don’t you try talking to it, i don’t have to do everything for you.
@dickle_angryflustered Dickle: fine! you’d leave a bad impression anyway!
		@vrachne_smug Vrachne: Fine. Lead the way.
		@quincy_gruff ???: HEY!

		@quincy_armscrossed ???: we’ve gotten a lot of tourists round here recently
		@quincy_armscrossed ???: pitch black and pitch white you know
		@quincy_armscrossed ???: don’t know where they came from
		@dickle_explaining Dickle: ahhhh
		@dickle_explaining Dickle: me and my friend here aren’t tourists we’re looking for something related to the sun i think!
		@dickle_explaining Dickle: we met a nice guy who told us to come here, he went by da-niver i think
		@quincy_talk ???: that weirdo with the speech impediment?
		@dickle_talkcrossed Dickle: that’s not a very nice thing to say about him but yeah that guy!
		@quincy_talk ???: oh no don’t worry we’re good pals, he likes to riff on me for working at the gate so i like to riff on him by making fun of the silly way he talks
		@dickle_talk Dickle: ohhhhh you sound like good buds
		@quincy_talk???: ahahha yeah
		@quincy_friendly ???: well any friend of da-niver is a friend of mine!
		@quincy_friendly ???: i’m Quincy, nice to meet you folk!
		@dickle_happy Dickle: nice to meet you quincy

		@dickle_talk Dickle: she uhhh doesn’t talk much
		@dickle_talk Dickle: anyway, this is a beautiful town you got here! 
		@quincy_friendly Quincy: it sure is, guess that’s why we’re getting so many tourists now!
		@quincy_friendly Quincy: you two said you were looking for something sun related yeah?
		@dickle_explaining Dickle: yep we’ve got important business relating to it, i think.
		@quincy_friendly Quincy: you must be looking for the #f6b26b Church of Lindas ## then! it’s the best church on the planet!
		@quincy_friendly Quincy: Mostly because it’s the only one that’s actually still running heh!
		@dickle_excited Dickle: yeah that sounds like the place!
		@quincy_talk Quincy: it’s the big building up north you can’t miss it! 
		@quincy_talk Quincy: it’s run by some great people, i’m sure they’ll be able to help you out with whatever you need!
		@dickle_excited Dickle: gotcha! Thanks for all your help quincy!
		@quincy_talk Quincy: no problem! just promise me something okay?
		@quincy_talk Quincy: please don’t destroy anyone’s property 
		@quincy_talk Quincy: most of the tourist people have been pretty nice but some are just… lets just say they’re TOO MUCH
		@quincy_talk Quincy: if anything else gets broken i might be out of a job!
		@dickle_talk Dickle: we’ll be on our best behaviour i promise!

@vrachne_smug Vrachne: sooooo dickle, you remember when i asked you what you were scared of right?
@dickle_excited Dickle: yeah? do i need to go on another ant rant because i’m ready to do another one!
@Vrachne_smugshrug Vrachne: i think i’ve heard enough about ants for a lifetime dickle. Butttttt what was the other thing you were scared of?
@Vrachne_smugcross Vrachne: you know the “general” answer.
@dickle_glasses Dickle Death.
@dickle_glasses Dickle: that’s about it.
@vrachne_talk  Vrachne: oh wow, to be honest i expected a more light hearted answer from someone named “Dickle”
@dickle_talk Dickle: i just hate the uncertainty of it all ya know.
@dickle_flustered Dickle: it scares me.
@dickle_flustered Dickle: just thinking about if one little thing goes wrong and then i’m just….
@dickle_flustered Dickle: Not here anymore.
@dickle_flustered Dickle: not getting to say goodbye to the people i care about. Or them not knowing it happened and just wondering “where’d he go” and i just can’t…
@vrachne_surprised Vrachne: are you crying?
@dickle_wipe Dickle: i’m fine i’m fine i’m fine sorry
@dickle_wipe Dickle: that sorta stuff just gets me going that’s all, that’s why i don’t think about it so much
@dickle_wipe Dickle: anyway what scares you vrachne? It’s only fair that you answer too right heh..
@vrachne_shrug Vrachne: same thing that scares you i guess, just for different reasons that i’d rather not go into.
@vrachne_talk Vrachne: but that’s why you have to live life to the fullest! throw caution to the wind sometimes
@vrachne_talk Vrachne: just don’t overdo it, thats how people die in their 20s
@dickle_wipe Dickle: yeah that’s a good way to look at it!
@dickle_wipe Dickle: i needed that, dankeschön vrachne!
@vrachne_surprised Vrachne: yeah uh, don’t mention it.

								@vrachne_talk Vrachne: Hey dickle
@dickle_talk Dickle: yeah?
@vrachne_talk Vrachne: do you mind if i ask you something?
@dickle_happy Dickle: sure! What do ya wanna know
@vrachne_talk Vrachne: Have you ever killed someone before?
@dickle_angryflustered Dickle: wha? NO?!
@dickle_angry Dickle: What kind of question is that?!
@vrachne_shrug Vrachne: hey i’m just throwing questions at the metaphorical question wall calm down
@vrachne_peevedcross Vrachne: it’s only fair considering how much you ask me about stuff.
@vrachne_smugcross Vrachne: though, judging by your response you must have some pretty strong feelings about violence am i right?
@dickle_angryflustered Dickle: i guess you could say that
@vrachne_peeved Vrachne: what are you some kind of “pacifist” or something?
@dickle_talk Dickle: i wouldn’t say that…. i just don’t think i have it in me to kill someone thats all!
@dickle_shrug Dickle: if i have to though i’ll hurt somebody but… only if they’re threatening me or someone i care about, something like that ya know?
@dickle_talk Dickle: other than that, physical fighting and all that jazz it just ain’t in my nature so to say
@vrachne_shrug Vrachne: you’ll have to fight eventually dickle, honestly it’s probably best that you get used to it now rather than later
@vrachne_talk Vrachne: take it from me.
@dickle_glasses Dickle: right… does that mean you’ve killed people before?
@vrachne_smugcross Vrachne: you seem to know me pretty well dickle so i’m sure you already know the answer to that question.
@dickle_talk Dickle: yeah...
@vrachne_smugshrug  Vrachne: but i did all that for a reason, they may not of been good reasons in hindsight but they were still reasons
@vrachne_talk Vrachne: and that’s very important. at least to me it is
@dickle_talk Dickle: is that so?
@vrachne_peeved Vrachne: yeah, wanton violence without a reason is just barbaric!
@vrachne_peeved Vrachne: i’ve got a code ya know
@dickle_talk Dickle: a code huh? 
@vrachne_peeved Vrachne: yeah dickle a code though maybe a better word would be standards? or maybe principles i don’t know.
@dickle_talk Dickle: if it’s like a certain way you like to approach things its principles i think?
@dickle_talk Dickle: i don’t know, i guess it really depends on what you’re trying to convey
@vrachne_peevedcross Vrachne: i’m saying there’s a way i like to go about things dickle, something i like to hold myself to
@dickle_talk Dickle: ahhhhh, well i think all three of those words you were thinking of woulda worked for that
@vrachne_talk Vrachne: english sure is a language.
@dickle_happy Dickle: hahahha yeah
@dickle_explaining Dickle: i’m kinda curious though, what are those like principles you have?
@vrachne_smug Vrachne: why do you wanna know eh dickle?
@dickle_shrug Dickle: no reason in particular really, i just like talking to people
@dickle_shrug Dickle: plus you have a pretty “interesting” way of looking at things so it’s always neat to hear what you have to say
@dickle_flustered Dickle: hope that doesn’t come off as weird or anything like that
@vrachne_smug Vrachne: it’s about as weird as most other things you say dickle i’ve gotten over it at this point.
@vrachne_explaining Vrachne: i have lots of little standards i hold myself to but there’s 3 important ones that matter way more than the others
@vrachne_one Vrachne: 1: “don’t force yourself onto others.” 
@vrachne_smug Vrachne: i’m sure the meaning of this one is pretty obvious considering how much you seem to know about monsters already.
@vrachne_two Vrachne: 2: “don’t use violence to solve every single problem.”
@vrachne_talk Vrachne: i’m not gonna lie, i enjoy a good fight every once and a while but i’ve come to learn that sometimes, it just isn’t worth the trouble.
@dickle_angryflustered Dickle: thats funny because that sure as hell didn’t stop you when we first met huh?
@vrachne_smugcross Vrachne: that was a special occasion, i was testing you.  Seeing where you needed to “improve”
@vrachne_peeved Vrachne: and it turns out you need to improve in a LOT of places. If you don’t know how to fight then this game will eat you alive.
@vrachne_peeved Vrachne: trust me.
@dickle_talk Dickle: i’ll take your word for it.
@vrachne_talk Vrachne: good. anyway onto the last one.
@vrachne_talk Vrachne: 3: don’t leave things half finished.
@vrachne_talk Vrachne: this one applies to just about anything i do. If i start doing something i’m going to finish it.
@vrachne_smugcross Vrachne: apparently that’s hard for some people which is something i find pretty funny.
@dickle_talkcrossed Dickle: those sound way simpler than i was expecting to be honest.
@vrachne_smugshrug Vrachne: oh no, i just condensed them somewhat so your brain could process it all
@vrachne_talk Vrachne: plus since we’re “partners” i expect you to “uphold” these standards.
@vrachne_smugcross Vrachne: you don’t have a problem with doing that, right?
@dickle_talk Dickle: yeah yeah fine.
@vrachne_smug Vrachne: good, i knew you’d see things my way, partner.
@dickle_talkcrossed Dickle: it’s not like i really have a choice.
@vrachne_peevedcrossed Vrachne: you always have a choice dickle. You just happen to know what the wrong one is so you don’t even think of it as an option.
@vrachne_peeved Vrachne: you certainly have more choices than i do. so you really don’t have any reason to complain.
@dickle_talk Dickle: i’m sorry. i guess.
@dickle_talk Dickle: anyway i’m fine with following your guidelines or whatever. They sound fine
@dickle_talk Dickle: and it’s always good to have those nowadays, guidelines i mean.
@vrachne_smug Vrachne: oh dear now i’m curious
@vrachne_smugcrossed Vrachne: are things really that bad where you come from or are you just talking things up?
@dickle_glasses Dickle:  i’ve seen lots of terrible things. That’s what being on the internet for most of your life will do to you.
@dickle_glasses Dickle: the world’s full of sick sick people vrachne.
@dickle_glasses Dickle: people who can’t empathize with the plights of others, people who can look at violence without a care in the world…
@dickle_glasses Dickle: honestly i think the worst thing you can be as a person is someone who’s desensitized to violence.
@vrachne_smugcross Vrachne: oh my i feel like you’re calling me out with that one 
@dickle_talk Dickle: not at all, i mean you do have your problems but you have enough sense to know that randomly hurting people isn’t okay, and i’m sure you can feel things like pity too
@dickle_shrug Dickle: hell, if you didn’t then you wouldn’t have your first code right?
@vrachne_peevedcross Vrachne: maybe, but i think you’re looking too far into things dickle.
@dickle_fingerguns Dickle: hmph yeah whatever ya say vrach!
@vrachne_peeved Vrachne: don’t call me that.
