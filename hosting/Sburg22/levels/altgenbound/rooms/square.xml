		<args>@! it's fun to babysit but i'm getting really tired of my brother's attitude.

he can't just admit he was in the wrong, maybe he should've done what normal people do and find an outhouse or something.

oh yeah don't let him know this but i know what he's saying right now.

@! Oh hello there! You two aren’t locals are you? You certainly don’t look like ones aside from the hair maybe.

I’m trying to learn more about this #9fc5e8 LINDAS## person for my “exotic” cultures columum in the #351c75 ONYX TIMES##, but the church seems to be closed to the public today. 

Apparently they’re expecting some important visitors or something like that. So interesting! I’ll have to write about this.

              @! A pretty interesting statue depicting what appears to be a spider person holding a very #f6b26b “SUNNY” ## lance for lack of a better word. Whoever they are they seem pretty important or at least important enough to have a statue in the middle of town.

		There appears to be an inscription on a plaque near the base of the statue as well.
