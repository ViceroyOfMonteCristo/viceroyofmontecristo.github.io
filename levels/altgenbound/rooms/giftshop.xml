			@mal_talk ???: thank you, tourism is in this season so i thought what better way to make a good buck than to open up a gift shop, we got everything here you could want 
			@mal_talk ???: clothes, a gun or two, attunements, fraymotiffs, tacky nonsense barely relating to anything here.
			@mal_talk ???: you know the good stuff. 
			@mal_talk ???: all of it is “locally sourced” by that i mean i just find it when i’m diving around and decide what to sell and what to throw back into the lake i found it in.
			@dickle_talk Dickle: wow that’s pretty cool
			@mal_talk ???: yep. now are you here to buy something?
			@dickle_talk Dickle: uh i actually don’t have any money.
