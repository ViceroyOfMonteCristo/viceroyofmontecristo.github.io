			@mal_talk ???: hello there sir, how are you this fine overcast
			@dickle_talk Dickle: i’m pretty good! this is a nice little shop place you have here!
			@mal_talk ???: thank you, tourism is in this season so i thought what better way to make a good buck than to open up a gift shop, we got everything here you could want 
			@mal_talk ???: clothes, a gun or two, attunements, fraymotiffs, tacky nonsense barely relating to anything here.
			@mal_talk ???: you know the good stuff. 
			@mal_talk ???: all of it is “locally sourced” by that i mean i just find it when i’m diving around and decide what to sell and what to throw back into the lake i found it in.
			@dickle_talk Dickle: wow that’s pretty cool
			@mal_talk ???: yep. now are you here to buy something?
			@dickle_talk Dickle: uh i actually don’t have any money.
			@mal_peeved ???: oh. you can leave then.
			@dickle_confused Dickle: excuse me?
			@mal_peeved ???: door's right behind you. thank you for coming to “Mal’s gift emporium”.

			@! Dersite: I’ve always wanted one of these old timey diving suits but she’s asking for a whole #f360f4 BOONCASE! ## What a ripoff.

			With that kinda moolah you could make your own diving suit, give it some cool mechanical parts and stuff too! 

			Maybe that’s what i’ll do with my leftover war bonds, i’ve come to find out that traveling around like this really ain’t my sorta thing.

			@! Prospitan: Man, the lady who runs this place is a scam artist! I blew a whole #f360f4 BOONBUCK ## on a “mystery box” and all I got was this lousy T-shirt and some “attunements”, and I don’t even know what the hell an “attunement” is!

The lady running the shop says they’re just some sort of medical thing, but what kind of medicine is called “#6aa84f Blooming## #a64d79 Love## #cfe2f3 White##“ or “#f6b26b Lightworkers## #fce5cd Blessings##“. Maybe it’s herbal or something? I don’t know.

Ugh, I feel like I just took part in a back alley drug deal or something; this’ll be the last time I ever spend money at a gift shop, that’s for sure.
