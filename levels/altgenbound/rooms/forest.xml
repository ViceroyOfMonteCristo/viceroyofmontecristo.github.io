	<!-- This is the first half of a big optimization. Some people have a lot of
	trouble rendering big images, even if only a small part is being requested. While
	in development we often use the "full" image, but once we go into production we
	slice up all the big background and foreground images into a grid so that it's
	easier for end users' computer to pick out the parts we want.
	All the images except for the bottom-most and right-most ones are 500x500. I
	find that's a good compromise for performance/complexity. 
	
	utils/image_slice/ has a utility for doing this automatically. -->

							@vrachne_peevedcross Vrachne: it’s just a simple question you’ve asked me lots of dumb simple stuff and you didn’t hear me make such a fuss about it. So come on just tell me, it’s only fair after all
							@dickle_flustered Dickle: I’m 16 alright! there are you happy?

							@vrachne_talk Vrachne: a lady gave you these?
							@dickle_shrug Dickle: i dunno maybe? honestly i don’t know, people are really “confusing” nowadays so it’s hard to tell.
							@dickle_talk Dickle: anyway even if i got these clothes by doing weird stuff, i like em a lot!

							@dickle_angryflustered Dickle: it’s a headband, if i look at myself in the mirror without one i just feel wrong. 
							@vrachne_talk Vrachne: then just wear a normal headband.
							@dickle_angryflustered Dickle: the horns make the entire thing vrachne! the outfit wouldn’t look nearly as good without em

								@vrachne_talk Vrachne: is this about your quest again? Its really simple dickle i don’t know how you cant get it into that tiny head of yours
								@dickle_talk Dickle: no no it’s a question about you!
								@vrachne_smug Vrachne: oh really now? Well go ahead then what do you wanna know about little ole me
								@dickle_talk Dickle: welllll its a pretty broad question but like, what’s being a sprite like?
								@vrachne_peeved Vrachne: what kind of question is that.
								@dickle_talk Dickle: i don’t know! Im trying my hardest here, i mean you’re like a kinda ghost kinda goo person so i’m just really curious about some stuff!
								@vrachne_peevedcross Vrachne: like what
								@dickle_think Dickle: like uhhh do you have to eat! Or sleep ya know stuff like that!
								@vrachne_peeved Vrachne: i’ll sleep when im dead dickle and as for me having to eat
								@vrachne_airquotes Vrachne: i don’t think im “supposed” to feel hunger but you never know how things will work out
								@vrachne_peevedcross Vrachne: things are pretty shoddy here if you couldn’t tell that already.
								@dickle_think Dickle: huh?
								@vrachne_armup Vrachne: this entire time we haven’t even run into a single underling! none. nada. ゼロ.
								Vrachne: isn’t that a little weird to you?
								@dickle_explaining Dickle: well i mean i just assumed we’d been really lucky so far! 
								@dickle_explaining Dickle: honestly i’m kinda scared of what ya know enemies and stuff we’d run into yeah?
								@dickle_explaining Dickle: because they like take after the first things we throw into the sprite thing right?
								@vrachne_armup Vrachne: they’re called underlings dickle and yes they do take after whatever people throw into their kernelsprites
								@vrachne_smugcross Vrachne: what, are you scared of getting assaulted by a long tongued poorly drawn imp? honestly the porn sword would probably scare them off or leave them too embarrassed to even fight properly HA
								@dickle_flustered Dickle: it’s not that! i’m just scared of what the others are gonna put in when they get in ya know?
								@vrachne_talk Vrachne: listen dickle i doubt they’ll put in anything TOO bad. If you think the worst possible thing is gonna happen every time you or someone else does something then you’ll never get anywhere
								@dickle_talk Dickle: yeah i guess

								@dickle_talk Dickle: well uh 
								@dickle_talk Dickle: do you have memories from like the parts that make you up? You know what i mean by that right
								@vrachne_shrug Vrachne: my memories are a big puddle of mush dickle, there’s some stuff that’s clear and some stuff that isn’t
								@dickle_talk Dickle: do you remember fighting any big green bad guys or maybe some weird purple haired hero and his weird snake lover person
								@vrachne_talk Vrachne: yeah i do, i wouldn’t forget those fights not by a long shot.
								@dickle_talk Dickle: if you don’t mind me asking did you win those fights?
								@vrachne_talk Vrachne: unfortunately i don’t remember how they ended just that i got into those fights.
								@dickle_talk Dickle: awwww that sucks
								@vrachne_smugcross Vrachne: knowing me though i probably came out on top!
								@vrachne_smugcross Vrachne: i’d never lose to an overgrown time traveling child or some wannabe hero and his pet snake!
								@dickle_talk Dickle: but uhhh what if you did?
								@vrachne_peevedcross Vrachne: are you doubting me dickle?
								@dickle_flustered Dickle: no no it’s just that since you can’t really remember we cant know for sure right?
								@vrachne_peevedcross Vrachne: well dickle, even if i did die, it didn’t “stick”
								@vrachne_smugcross Vrachne: it never does, i’ll always find a way back thats why im here, it’s one of those talents i told you about
								@dickle_think Dickle: that’s a pretty busted talent vrachne
								@vrachne_smug  Vrachne: i suppose it is but i’m not complaining

								@vrachne_think Vrachne: well there is something i really REALLY like, though it’s a bit out there.
								@dickle_flustered Dickle: you know on second thought you don’t have to answer that!
								@dickle_flustered Dickle: i have a lot of ham back at home, maybe once we’re done here we can go back and eat some sandwiches or something yeah?
								@dickle_flustered Dickle: a lunch break is always important! People might say breakfast is the most important meal of the day but they just say that to make people wake up earlier and buy cereal boxes!
