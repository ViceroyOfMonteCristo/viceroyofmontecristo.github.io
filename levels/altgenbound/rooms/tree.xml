		@dickle_glasses Dickle: oh god is this it
		@vrachne_talk Vrachne: judging by the fact that it’s a big tree, i’d say yes.
		@dickle_excited Dickle: oh thank GOD FINALLY
		@dickle_talk Dickle: this thing sure looks different up close eh vrachne?
		@vrachne_explaining Vrachne: distance is a hell of a thing, the glasses probably didn’t help that much either.
		@dickle_talk Dickle: you got that right
		@dickle_talkcrossed Dickle: thing looks like a modern art sculpture hehehehe
		@dickle_talkcrossed Dickle: whole lot of nothing around here though, are you sure this is the place we’re looking for?
		@vrachne_explaining Vrachne: trees don’t just grow like this dickle, someone or something must’ve made it like this.
		@vrachne_explaining Vrachne: maybe you should try actually looking around before declaring there’s “nothing” here.
		@dickle_talk Dickle: alright alright fine let’s look around then

		@dickle_happy Dickle: oh hey wait there’s a hole here vrachne!
		@vrachne_peeved Vrachne: i’m right behind you dickle you don’t need to yell
		@dickle_talk Dickle: right, sorry.
		@vrachne_peeved Vrachne: told you there was something here.
		@dickle_flustered Dickle: yeah yeah you don’t have to rub it in.
		@vrachne_smug Vrachne: oh i know, but i like doing it anyway.
		@vrachne_smug Vrachne: it helps people learn important lessons!
		@vrachne_smugshrug Vrachne: lessons like “how to actually use your eyes to see very obvious things”
		@vrachne_smugcrossed Vrachne: which is a pretty niche lesson i do admit, but obviously it’s helped you out (::.
		@dickle_angryflustered Dickle: Verpiss Dich! my glasses are all foggy, i’m tired and the tree is all one color! It all blended together!
		@dickle_angryflustered Dickle: can we just get in this hole already?!
		@vrachne_chuckle Vrachne: ahueahueahueahue 
		@vrachne_smug Vrachne: you really do have a way with words dickle
		@vrachne_smugairquotes Vrachne: but sure, i’d love to “explore” a hole with you.
		@dickle_glasses Dickle: we might not like what we find in it.
		@dickle_glasses Dickle: i learned that the hard way.
		@vrachne_smugcross Vrachne: what’d you find in the last “weird hole” that you explored dickle? 
		@dickle_talk Dickle: sword with porn on it.
		@vrachne_talk Vrachne: you’re joking.
		@dickle_talk Dickle: no really! It was my dad’s old porn sword actually
		@dickle_explaining Dickle: it was really bad porn and i used it to make my sword that has slightly more acceptable porn on it!
		@vrachne_laugh Vrachne: AHUEAHUEAHUEAHUEAHUE
		@vrachne_laugh Vrachne: gosh your family sounds like an absolute “riot” dickle.
		@dickle_talk Dickle: tell me about it! thankfully i don’t have a sister
		@dickle_talk Dickle: shudder to think about what she’d put on a sword
		@dickle_talk Dickle: anyway enough about me and my weird family
		@dickle_talk Dickle: it’s time for cave explore!
		@vrachne_smugcross Vrachne: you first, dickle.
		@dickle_talk Dickle: wouldn’t have it any other way
