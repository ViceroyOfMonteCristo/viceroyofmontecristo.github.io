@allay_think Allay: now where was i?
@allay_talk Allay: oh yeah! You two are tourists right? you gotta be!
@dickle_talk Dickle: uhhh yeah sure i guess you could say that! though it’s more of a business sorta trip heh 
@allay_talk Allay: ooooo if you don’t mind me asking, what sort of business is it?
@dickle_talk Dickle: i’m sorta in the process of figuring that out myself but i think it’s pretty important
@allay_talk Allay: well whatever kind of business it is i wish you the best of luck with it!
@allay_talk Allay: now is there anything you’d like?
@dickle_talk Dickle: uhhhhh i’m not sure! what do you guys sell here
@aster_talk Aster: right what it says on the tin baby! Plush and plush accessories all day every day!
@allay_aster Allay: Aster….
@allay_flustered Allay: sorry about her she gets rowdy when she works the back
@allay_talk Allay: we mostly make and sell our own plushies here!
@dickle_excited Dickle: you make all these by hand?!
@dickle_excited Dickle: that’s pretty cool!
@aster_talk Aster: you bet your ass it is! hey Allay these are the coolest customers we’ve gotten in weeks!
@allay_aster Allay: Aster! what did i tell you about using that kind of language in the workplace!
@aster_talk Aster: sorry “boss” hehehehhehehe
@allay_flustered Allay: again i’m so sorry about her i don’t know why she’s like this….
@dickle_talk Dickle: it’s all good i’m used to that kinda talk anyway!
@dickle_talk Dickle: anyway i’d love to get a plush but i’m sadly out of cash.
@allay_talk Allay: awwww that’s too bad
@allay_talk Allay: still feel free to look around! touching the merchandise is free after all! the only thing that costs money is taking it home!
@allay_talk Allay: that and getting a custom made plush!
@dickle_excited Dickle: whoa really?!
@allay_talk Allay: mhm! actually most of our business comes from making custom plushies for people!
@allay_talk  Allay: it’s a real hit with the kids and the tourists too! 
@dickle_excited Dickle: that’s awesome!
@dickle_talk Dickle: well if i ever do get some cash i’ll be sure to come back and take you up on that offer!
@allay_flustered Allay: that would be lovely! It’d be so nice to work off of someone who looks so well “different” 
@allay_talk Allay: actually if you don’t mind me asking whats your name?
@dickle_talk Dickle: just call me Dickle! It’s what everyone calls me
@allay_talk Allay: well it was a pleasure to meet you dickle feel free to come back anytime!
